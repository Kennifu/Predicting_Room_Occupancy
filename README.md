# Predicting Room Occupancy

**Software used**: R

**Goal**: To determine the best classifier for predicting room occupancy. Room occupancy can be important in the future for using machine learning to determine whether a building should be evacuated, rather than waiting until a smoke alarm goes off. In this project, I discover the best machine learning classifier between LDA, QDA, logistic regression, and a binary decision tree. 

**Instructions**:
Open the "Predicting Room Occupancy" file in any format of your choice. The available formats are: .html, .txt, .pdf, and .rmd. 

**Table of Contents**:

+ Introduction
+ Exploratory Data Analysis
  + Data Description
  + Simple EDA 
+ Modeling
  + Linear Discriminant Analysis
  + Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
  + Binary Logistic Regression
  + Binary Classification Tree
+ Final Recommendation and Discussion

**Results**: 

A binary decision tree classifier wins by a longshot, with only a 2% error rate on predictions compared to the other classification methods, which have about a 7% error rate.
